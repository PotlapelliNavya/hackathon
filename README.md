ü§ñ AI-Powered Mental Health Support Chatbot

üìå Project Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered chatbot that offers accessible, real-time mental health support and counseling. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and pre-trained language models, the chatbot understands user emotions, responds empathetically, and provides helpful mental wellness guidance. The tool serves as a supportive, non-judgmental first line of help‚Äîespecially for individuals who are hesitant to seek traditional therapy.

This project was completed as part of a portfolio-level application in AI and NLP, demonstrating skills in machine learning, ethical AI, and human-centered design.

üéØ Objectives

Build an intelligent chatbot that provides safe and empathetic mental health responses.

Utilize NLP techniques to understand user intent and emotional tone.

Apply sentiment analysis (VADER, TextBlob, or transformer-based models) to tailor replies.

Offer curated mental health tips, self-care routines, and emergency support links.

Maintain user privacy, data security, and comply with ethical AI standards.

Present the project in a professional, portfolio-ready format.

üîç Key Insights

Mental health chatbots offer 24/7 anonymous support, reducing stigma.

Emotion detection enhances chatbot response quality and empathy.

Many users show signs of emotional distress through subtle linguistic cues.

Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa perform well in understanding emotional context.

Ethical AI design‚Äîespecially for sensitive topics‚Äîis critical to ensure trust and safety.

üõ† Project Workflow

1)Data Collection & Preprocessing

* Use mental health-related datasets (e.g., DAIC-WOZ, Reddit mental health forums, Kaggle).

* Clean, normalize, and preprocess conversations for training.

2)Model Selection & Training

* Use pre-trained NLP models like DialogPT, Rasa, or fine-tuned GPT-2/GPT-3.

* Train a sentiment classifier (e.g., using VADER or RoBERTa) to detect emotional tone.

3)Chatbot Development

* Develop chatbot logic for multiple intents: stress, anxiety, depression, gratitude, motivation.

* Add fallback mechanisms and escalation messages for crisis scenarios.

4)Integration of Resources

* Integrate helpful responses, mindfulness practices, and redirect to human resources (hotlines or therapists) when needed.

5)Deployment

* Deploy on platforms like Streamlit, Telegram, Discord, or web interface via Flask/Django.

6)Testing & Feedback Loop

* Conduct user testing and collect feedback.

* Fine-tune the model and chatbot flow for improved interaction quality.
