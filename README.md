 
The main motive of an AI-powered mental health chatbot is to give people a safe, private, and always-available space to share their feelings, get emotional support, and receive helpful guidance — even if they can’t talk to a human therapist right away.
It’s like having a friendly, non-judgmental companion in your pocket that listens to you, understands how you’re feeling, and gently helps you cope, anytime and anywhere.
